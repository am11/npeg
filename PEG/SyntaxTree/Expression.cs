    /// The operator overloading contained here attempts to approximate the actual PEG grammar within
    /// the syntax of C#.  The normal PEG operators have been changed as follows:
    ///
    /// sequence: No operator, just expressions followed in succession.
    ///     This would be illegal in C# so the '+' operator is used to separate expressions in a sequence.
    /// ordered choice: '/'
    ///     The precedence of this operator in C# would be far too high so has been changed to the traditional
    ///     pipe character ('|') which has very low precedence.
    /// one or more: '+'
    ///     In C# it's the same, but the unary operator must precede the expression, rather than be a suffix.
    ///     i.e.  +a instead of a+.
    /// zero or more: '*'
    ///     In C#, '*' is not a valid unary operator, so has been changed to '-'.  Use as a prefix.
    /// optional: '?'
    ///     In C#, '?' is not a valid unary operator, so has been changed to '~'.  Again, as a prefix.
    /// and predicate: '&'
    ///     We have run out of operators, so we will use a extension method named "And".
    /// not predicate: '!'
    ///     Exactly the same.
