# Packrat Parser in C#
---
This parser is an implementation of a [Packrat Parser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar) with support for
[left-recursion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_recursion). The algorithm for left recursion is a modified version of
[Packrat parsers can support left recursion](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1328408.1328424). 

## Packrat Parsers

A normal PackRat parser utilizes a Parsing Expression Grammar (PEG) and parses input in linear time.  This parser does the same, 
but allows for PEGs that contain left-recursion, a staple for anyone familiar with BNF while still maintaining near linear-time.
A PEG is far more expressive than BNF, allowing for conditional, not, zero/one or more, and other useful operators.  The syntax 
of a standard PEG has been modified to allow the grammars to be expressed naturally using C# syntax.

This parser is intended to be just as convenient to use for building a full-scale grammar as for simple ad hoc search/replace in 
strings.  It allows for grammars as sophisticated as languages such as C# itself, to patterns that are simple and nearly as 
concise as regular expressions (but far more scrutable). Before going into depth on what each operator is about, letâ€™s look at 
some small examples.

### Decimals

Let's start with a simple pattern that will match a decimal number such as 1, 42, 3.14, -9, etc. First let's create a pattern to handle 1:

``` c#
varr pattern = '0'.To('9');
```

This creates a pattern that accepts any character between 0 and 9, in other words, a digit.  To test this pattern for 1 we simply call the Match(...) method:

``` c#
bool result = pattern.Match("1");
```

Since `1` is a valid character, it would be accepted by this pattern.  What about `42`?  `4` is a valid character, and so is `2`, so will it accept this input?   The answer is no, because we have designed the pattern to only account for a single digit. Since `42` has two digits, it fails. We'll have to modify our pattern to support multiple digits.Fortunately, that is easy -- we can just use the `+` operator to indicate that one or more digits in a row are allowed:

``` c#
var pattern = +'0'.To('9');
```

The plus `+` unary prefix operator requires at least one instance of its operand to be in the input, but allows any number of valid subsequent instances.  In this case, `'0'.To('9')` is the operand so this allows any number of digits.  Thus, `42` is now allowed.

Clearly `3.14` will fail as we've done nothing to account for the decimal point.  Let's modify the pattern:

``` c#
var pattern = +'0'.To('9') + '.' + +'0'.To('9');
```

While this works, it's probably a bit vexing that `'0'.To('9')` is repeated twice.  We can easily fix that by simply declaring a variable:

``` c#
var digit = +'0'.To('9');
var pattern = digit + '.' + digit;
```

Unfortunately, with our change, it now requires the decimal point, so our first two examples now fail.  This is easy to fix using the optional operator, expressed as a tilde `~`:

``` c#
var pattern = digit + ~('.' + digit);
```

Finally, we need to handle the minus sign `-`:

``` c#
var pattern = ~'-'._() + digit + ~('.' + digit);
```

And there you have it, a pattern that can handle any integer or decimal number.

You may be asking yourself about `._()`.  The problem is that all the operators you've seen so far work on the class Expression. `.` is a char, and thus the `~` operator won't work on it.   One solution is to create an extension method that takes a char and returns a CharacterTerminal (a type of Expression) based off it.  That is what the `._()` extension method on char is, and hence the syntax.  It was chosen to be short and minimize distraction.

### Quoted Strings

To illustrate the use of some other operators, let's create a pattern to match quoted string literals as you see in many languages (such as C#).  Some valid values:  `"value"`, `""`, `"a \"quote\""`.   We'll start by creating a pattern that can match `"value"`:

``` c#
var pattern = '"' + +Peg.Any + '"';
```

That is, a double-quote, the special operator Any, and a final double-quote.  The Any operator will accept any possible character.  But wait, surly this includes the double-quote!  How then do you terminate the string?  The answer is to also use the not operator `!`:

``` c#
var pattern = '"' + +(!'"'._() + Peg.Any) + '"';
```

So the one-or-more operator + was used on the expression `(!'"'._() + Peg.Any)`.  The not operator never consumes input, but will cause the Sequence to fail.  In this case, that failure will mean that the one-or-more operator will stop consuming further characters.  At that point, we arrive at the final double-quote and accept it. 

Next, will this pattern successfully match the empty string, `""`?  Since we are using a one-or-more operator, it will not!  Since having no characters between the double-quotes is an acceptable match, we need to replace the operator with the zero-or-more operator:

``` c#
var pattern = '"' + -(!'"'._() + Peg.Any) + '"';
```

As you can see, we switched the `+` for the `-`; the minus sign indicates zero-or-more.  Since zero is less than one (and vice versa), hopefully the symbols should be easy to remember. For the finishing touch, we want to allow double-quote characters so long as they are properly escaped with the backslash:

``` c#
var pattern = '"' + -(!('"'._() | @"\") + Peg.Any | @"\\" | @"\""") + '"';
```

Where before it was a one-or-more of "not the double-quote and any character" now it is a one-or-more of "neither the double-quote nor the backslash plus any character or two backslashes in a row (an escaped backslash) or a backslash followed by a double-quote (an escaped double-quote)".  With just a short pattern like this, we have a powerful way to parse any double-quoted string, including the ability to escape the double-quote. 

It's true, some of this syntax may look pretty foreign.  But one thing to remember is that this is all C#.  This means that you get all the help that you're used to from C#:
