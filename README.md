# Packrat Parser in C#
---
This parser is an implementation of a [Packrat Parser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar) with support for [left-recursion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_recursion). The algorithm for left recursion is a modified version of
[Packrat parsers can support left recursion](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1328408.1328424). 

## Packrat Parsers

A normal PackRat parser utilizes a Parsing Expression Grammar (PEG) and parses input in linear time.  This parser does the same, but allows for PEGs that contain left-recursion, a staple for anyone familiar with BNF while still maintaining near linear-time. A PEG is far more expressive than BNF, allowing for conditional, not, zero/one or more, and other useful operators.  The syntax of a standard PEG has been modified to allow the grammars to be expressed naturally using C# syntax.

This parser is intended to be just as convenient to use for building a full-scale grammar as for simple ad hoc search/replace in strings.  It allows for grammars as sophisticated as languages such as C# itself, to patterns that are simple and nearly as 
concise as regular expressions (but far more scrutable). Before going into depth on what each operator is about, letâ€™s look at 
some small examples.

### Decimals

Let's start with a simple pattern that will match a decimal number such as 1, 42, 3.14, -9, etc. First let's create a pattern to handle 1:

``` c#
var pattern = '0'.To('9');
```

This creates a pattern that accepts any character between 0 and 9, in other words, a digit.  To test this pattern for 1 we simply call the Match(...) method:

``` c#
bool result = pattern.Match("1");
```

Since `1` is a valid character, it would be accepted by this pattern.  What about `42`?  `4` is a valid character, and so is `2`, so will it accept this input?   The answer is no, because we have designed the pattern to only account for a single digit. Since `42` has two digits, it fails. We'll have to modify our pattern to support multiple digits.Fortunately, that is easy -- we can just use the `+` operator to indicate that one or more digits in a row are allowed:

``` c#
var pattern = +'0'.To('9');
```

The plus `+` unary prefix operator requires at least one instance of its operand to be in the input, but allows any number of valid subsequent instances.  In this case, `'0'.To('9')` is the operand so this allows any number of digits.  Thus, `42` is now allowed.

Clearly `3.14` will fail as we've done nothing to account for the decimal point.  Let's modify the pattern:

``` c#
var pattern = +'0'.To('9') + '.' + +'0'.To('9');
```

While this works, it's probably a bit vexing that `'0'.To('9')` is repeated twice.  We can easily fix that by simply declaring a variable:

``` c#
var digit = +'0'.To('9');
var pattern = digit + '.' + digit;
```

Unfortunately, with our change, it now requires the decimal point, so our first two examples now fail.  This is easy to fix using the optional operator, expressed as a tilde `~`:

``` c#
var pattern = digit + ~('.' + digit);
```

Finally, we need to handle the minus sign `-`:

``` c#
var pattern = ~'-'._() + digit + ~('.' + digit);
```

And there you have it, a pattern that can handle any integer or decimal number.

You may be asking yourself about `._()`.  The problem is that all the operators you've seen so far work on the class Expression. `.` is a char, and thus the `~` operator won't work on it.   One solution is to create an extension method that takes a char and returns a CharacterTerminal (a type of Expression) based off it.  That is what the `._()` extension method on char is, and hence the syntax.  It was chosen to be short and minimize distraction.

### Quoted Strings

To illustrate the use of some other operators, let's create a pattern to match quoted string literals as you see in many languages (such as C#).  Some valid values:  `"value"`, `""`, `"a \"quote\""`.   We'll start by creating a pattern that can match `"value"`:

``` c#
var pattern = '"' + +Peg.Any + '"';
```

That is, a double-quote, the special operator Any, and a final double-quote.  The Any operator will accept any possible character.  But wait, surly this includes the double-quote!  How then do you terminate the string?  The answer is to also use the not operator `!`:

``` c#
var pattern = '"' + +(!'"'._() + Peg.Any) + '"';
```

So the one-or-more operator + was used on the expression `(!'"'._() + Peg.Any)`.  The not operator never consumes input, but will cause the Sequence to fail.  In this case, that failure will mean that the one-or-more operator will stop consuming further characters.  At that point, we arrive at the final double-quote and accept it. 

Next, will this pattern successfully match the empty string, `""`?  Since we are using a one-or-more operator, it will not!  Since having no characters between the double-quotes is an acceptable match, we need to replace the operator with the zero-or-more operator:

``` c#
var pattern = '"' + -(!'"'._() + Peg.Any) + '"';
```

As you can see, we switched the `+` for the `-`; the minus sign indicates zero-or-more.  Since zero is less than one (and vice versa), hopefully the symbols should be easy to remember. For the finishing touch, we want to allow double-quote characters so long as they are properly escaped with the backslash:

``` c#
var pattern = '"' + -(!('"'._() | @"\") + Peg.Any | @"\\" | @"\""") + '"';
```

Where before it was a one-or-more of "not the double-quote and any character" now it is a one-or-more of "neither the double-quote nor the backslash plus any character or two backslashes in a row (an escaped backslash) or a backslash followed by a double-quote (an escaped double-quote)".  With just a short pattern like this, we have a powerful way to parse any double-quoted string, including the ability to escape the double-quote. 

It's true, some of this syntax may look pretty foreign.  But one thing to remember is that this is all C#.  This means that you get all the help that you're used to from C#:

## API Reference

A PEG is built by composing complex expressions together based on simpler ones.   When they are composed inline as C# expressions and statements, they are referred to as patterns.  (These are what you saw in the two samples above)  Patterns are concise and easy to whip up when the need arises. Some disadvantages to them are that they are anonymous and they cannot support recursion.   For example, we earlier declared digit this way:

``` c#
var digit = +'0'.To('9');
var pattern = digit + '.' + digit;
```

`pattern.ToString()` would yield `"? + '.' + ?"`.  If you want more readable strings, it is possible to name them explicitly:

``` c#
var digit = +'0'.To('9').Name("digit");
```

Feels a little dirty to type `"digit"` twice but now, `pattern.ToString()` would yield `"digit + '.' + digit"` -- just as you typed it.  

Patterns also cannot support recursion.  For example, this simple domain name pattern is not possible:

``` c#
var word = +'a'.To('Z');
var domain = domain + '.' + word | word;
```

This fails because we are trying to use domain before we have finished declaring it.  An alternative approach is to define a class that represents your syntax, and this is called a grammar.  A grammar is composed of a series of instance methods that return an Expression.  Each method represents a nonterminal.  (We created a nonterminal in the above example when we called `.Name("digit"))`.   A grammar for the above domain pattern would be:

``` c#
public class DomainGrammar : Grammar<DomainGrammar>
{
    public virtual Expression Domain()
    {
        return Domain() + '.' + Word() | Word();
    }

    public virtual Expression Word()
    {
        return +'a'.To('Z');
    }
}
```

As you can see, using this syntax it is possible for `Domain()` to recursively call itself.   Also, the nonterminals in a grammar are automatically named, saving you the step of calling the `.Name(...)` method as earlier. Grammars also have the advantage of publicly exposing the nonterminals in a way that is accessible for later mapping.   They are especially suited for constructing grammars for more complex languages, though can be used for the simplest patterns if desired.  

Now let's take a look at all the expressions you have available to you.

### Make Expression (`._()`)

Sometimes you have a value that you want to convert into an `Expression`.  For example, you can generally use strings and characters in combination with binary operators where the other operand is already an `Expression`. Often, though, you want to apply operations on a value that isn't already an `Expression`.  For example, suppose you want an expression that connotes "one or more `5` characters".  You can't just write:

``` c#
var fives = +'5';
```

This is because the C# expression `'5'` is not an `Expression`, so you can't use the `+` operator on it.  The solution is to use the extension method `_`, available in particular on character and expression expressions.  Thus to make the above code work, you'd write:

``` c#
var fives = +'5'._()
```

The `'5'._()` construct says, "first take the c# character `'5'`, transform it into an `Expression` (via `._()`) and then apply the `+` operator on it. In the end we have a one-or-more `Expression` operating against the character `'5'`.

### Sequence (`+`)

A sequence allows you to define a string of expressions that must be satisfied.  It overloads the `+` operator so use it in the same way to concatenate two expressions together.

``` c#
    '@' + Peg.Any
```

This expression would allow any string that starts with a `@` symbol.

### Ordered Choice (`|`)

The ordered choice allows you to provide a set of possible patterns that will match.  Important: this operator evaluates from left to right.  That means the first match will be chosen, even if there is a potentially better match in a later choice.  As this is C#, it has lower precedence than the sequence `+` operator.  This means that by default (without parentheses) an ordered choice is composed of sequences (or even simpler expressions).  For example,

``` c#
'a' | 'b' + 'c'
```

This pattern allows `"a"` or `"bc"`, but not `"ab"` and not `"bc"`.  In other words, it's a choice between `'a'` or `'b'` + `'c'`.  What if we wanted a choice between `'a'` or `'b'` and then plus `'c'`?   Just use parentheses:

``` c#
('a' | 'b') + 'c'
```

Now the strings "ac" and "bc" are accepted.

### One Or More (`+`)

While the same symbol as the Sequence operator, this uses the `+` unary prefix operator, and not the `+` binary operator.  Whatever expression follows the `+` may repeat any number of times but at least one iteration must match.

``` c#
+'a'._() + 'b'
```

This pattern must start with the `a` character and can be followed by any number of additional `a` characters, so long as it ends with a `b`.  So `"ab"`, `"aab"`, and `"aaaab"` are all valid, but `"b"` is not.

### Zero Or More (`-`)

Exactly like the one-or-more operator except it does not require at least one match.  In practice this acts like the "optional" variant of the one-or-more operator. 

``` c#
-'a'._() + 'b'
```

This pattern will accept any number of `a` characters (including none) followed by a `b`.  So `"ab"`, `"aab"`, and `"b"` are all valid.

### Optional (`~`)

Whatever expression follows the operator is considered optional.  This means that if the expression accepts the input, then it is used.  If, however, the expression fails to accept the input, it is ignored and parsing proceeds to the subsequent expression.

``` c#
'a' + ~'b'._() + 'c'
```

Here the 'b' is optional so "abc" and "ac" are valid.
 
### And (`.And(...)`)
 
The operand must be satisfied.  However, even upon success no input is consumed.  Often used at the end of a sequence to verify that the input that follows the current sequence has a certain value.

``` c#
'a'._() + 'b' + "c"._().And() + +Peg.Any
```

Here we say, "allow the sequence of characters `a`, followed by `b`, *and* followed by `c`, but otherwise allowing any other following sequence of characters.

### Not (`!`)

The operand must not be satisfied.  If it is satisfied, then the parse fails. In this example, we allow the sequence `"ab"`, but it *must* be followed with `c`. Otherwise, any other following sequence of characters is valid.

``` c#
'a'._() + 'b' + !'c'._() + +Peg.Any
```
