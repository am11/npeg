# Packrat Parser in C#
---
This parser is an implementation of a [Packrat Parser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar) with support for
[left-recursion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_recursion). The algorithm for left recursion is a modified version of
[Packrat parsers can support left recursion](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1328408.1328424). 

## Packrat Parsers

A normal PackRat parser utilizes a Parsing Expression Grammar (PEG) and parses input in linear time.  This parser does the same, 
but allows for PEGs that contain left-recursion, a staple for anyone familiar with BNF while still maintaining near linear-time.
A PEG is far more expressive than BNF, allowing for conditional, not, zero/one or more, and other useful operators.  The syntax 
of a standard PEG has been modified to allow the grammars to be expressed naturally using C# syntax.

This parser is intended to be just as convenient to use for building a full-scale grammar as for simple ad hoc search/replace in 
strings.  It allows for grammars as sophisticated as languages such as C# itself, to patterns that are simple and nearly as 
concise as regular expressions (but far more scrutable). Before going into depth on what each operator is about, letâ€™s look at 
some small examples.

### Decimals

Let's start with a simple pattern that will match a decimal number such as 1, 42, 3.14, -9, etc. First let's create a pattern to handle 1:
